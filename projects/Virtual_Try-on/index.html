	In this work, we transform the virtual try-on mission into a fashion image
	completion task. That is, given a portrait missing a piece of clothing, we want to
	generate a complete fashion image with high realism, diversity and compatibility. By
	proposing a two-stage fashion image completion network, we divide the generation
	process into two sub-processes: shape generation and texture synthesis, which realize
	hierarchical control of shape and texture, and improve the realism of the generated
	image. In each sub-process, we use the idea of Variational Autoencoder: map the control
	information to the latent space and then utilize the random sampling to realize the
	variety of generated images. At the same time, we introduce two interrelated encoders to
	explicitly control the compatibility among clothing items. In addition, we use methods
	such as generative adversarial networks, attention mechanism, and spectral
	normalization to further improve the quality of generated images and stabilize the
	training process. We test our model on DeepFashion dataset and compare our model
	with other similar work, the result of which confirm that our model has excellent
	performance in the fashion image completion task.
