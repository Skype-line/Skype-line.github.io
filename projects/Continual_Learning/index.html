	Continual learning is of great importance for autonomous agents since it is 
	impossible to provide the artificial intelligent with all the knowledge it 
	need in the real world. While previous work has proposed a large amount of 
	continual learning methods, little research has been done on the segmentation 
	task. For autonomous mobile robots, the differentiation of foreground and 
	background matters a lot for the safety consideration. Therefore, we aim to 
	solve the continual learning for binary foreground and background segmentation task. 

	To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, the biggest problem of continual learning, 
	we totally implement five continual learning methods including <b>fine-tuning 
	(baseline), output distillation, feature distillation, EWC and Progress & Compress</b>. 
	Apart from the naive fine-tuning, the last four methods all adopt techniques to 
	preserve the old knowledge. The first three add regularization terms on the output 
	space, feature space and weight space respectively. The last one reuses the old 
	parameters with a layerwise lateral connection in the model architecture. We evaluate 
	and compare those methods on NYU and CLA dataset of different types of scene. 
	The result demonstrates that continual learning methods can prevent catastrophic 
	forgetting to a certain degree only when the old scene and new scene are similar. 
	When two scenes differ a lot, the regularization-based methods may not be a good choice.
