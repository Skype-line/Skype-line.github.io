	Framework of the second training stage of our method. The interaction data is recorded in a replay buffer, that learn 
	the dynamics model and reward model. The data pairs are also extended to longer trajectories using model-based prediction 
	<br>and planning, which can guide policy learning and value learning. The updated policy is again utilized for generating 
	new interaction data. The planning horizon is gradually reduced during training.

	Model-free reinforcement learning methods could achieve very 
	good performance but typically requires a substantial amount of 
	data collection for convergence. On the other hand, model-based 
	methods tend to be more sample efficient but suffer from the bias of 
	the learned models. In this work, we aim to combine the advantages 
	of these approaches. We design a model-based learning framework 
	that is integrated with value learning. By gradually reducing the
	planning horizon, it transforms into pure model-free actor-critic
	learning as the training goes. The experiments show that, for 
	environments with relatively stable dynamics and lower dimensions
	for action space, our proposed method reaches high performance
	faster compared with baselines. The code is publicly available.
