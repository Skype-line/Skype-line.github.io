	We present X-Avatar, a novel avatar model that captures the full expressiveness 
	of digital humans to bring about life-like experiences in telepresence, AR/VR 
	and beyond. Our method models bodies, hands, facial expressions and appearance 
	in a holistic fashion and can be learned from either full 3D scans or RGB-D data.
	To achieve this, we propose a part-aware learned forward skinning module that can 
	be driven by the parameter space of SMPL-X, allowing for expressive animation of 
	X-Avatar. To efficiently learn the neural shape and deformation fields, we propose 
	novel part-aware sampling and initialization strategies. This leads to higher 
	fidelity results, especially for smaller body parts while maintaining efficient 
	training despite increased number of articulated bones. To capture the appearance 
	of the avatar with high-frequency details, we extend the geometry and deformation 
	fields with a texture network that is conditioned on pose, facial expression, 
	geometry and the normals of the deformed surface. We show experimentally that our 
	method outperforms strong baselines in both data domains both quantitatively and 
	qualitatively on the animation task. To facilitate future research on expressive 
	avatars we contribute a new dataset, called X-Humans, containing 234 sequences 
	of high-quality textured scans from 20 participants, totalling 35,000 data frames.
